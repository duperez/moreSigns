### Overview

**Farmer's Delight** is a mod that gently expands upon farming and cooking in Minecraft.

Using a simple cooking system and a few familiar ingredients, you'll be able to prepare a wide variety of **hearty meals**: from sandwiches to salads and stews, from beautiful desserts to mouth-watering feasts, no ingredient will be left behind in your kitchen!

It also introduces a rich set of utilities: a way to **improve the very soil** your crops grow in, a brand new kind of tool to **scavenge resources** with, cute **decorations** for your builds, and many blocks and items to help you on your adventure!

It's time to farm a little bit of everything!
